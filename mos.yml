# Custom configuration entries, settable via "device configuration"
# Below is a custom firmware configuration example.
# Uncomment and modify according to your needs:

#  - ["tardis_app.bool_value", "b", false, {title: "Some boolean value"}]
#  - ["tardis_app.string_value", "s", "", {title: "Some string value"}]
#  - ["tardis_app.int_value", "i", 123, {title: "Some integer value"}]
  - ["board.ledT.pin", "i", 5, {title: "LED GPIO pin"}]
  - ["board.led1.active_high", "b", false, {title: "True if LED is on when output is high (1)"}]
  - ["board.ledA.pin", "i", 16, {title: "LED GPIO pin"}]
  - ["board.ledA.active_high", "b", false, {title: "True if LED is on when output is high (1)"}]
  - ["board.ledB.pin", "i", 17, {title: "LED GPIO pin"}]
  - ["board.ledB.active_high", "b", false, {title: "True if LED is on when output is high (1)"}]
  - ["board.ledC.pin", "i", 18, {title: "LED GPIO pin"}]

  - ["board.ledD.pin", "i", 19, {title: "LED GPIO pin"}]

# These settings get compiled into the C structure, and can be accessed
# from the C code this way:
#
# printf("Hello from %s!\n", mgos_sys_config_get_device_id());
#
# Settings are cool: can be modified remotely without full firmware upgrade!
#
# To see all available compiled settings, buid the firmware and open
# build/gen/mgos_config.h file.
#
# Also, in this config_schema section, you can override existing
# settings that has been created by other libraries. For example, debug log
# level is 2 by default. For this firmware we can override it to 3:
#
# config_schema:
#  - ["debug.level", 3]
